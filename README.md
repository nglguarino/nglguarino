## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
I'm fascinated by the idea of building something that will be infinitely smarter than us. My research interest is in self-improving systems.

- **Generative AI** - Text and image synthesis
- **Self-Improving Systems** - Reinforcement learning, meta learning, and autonomous feedback loops
- **AI Safety & Alignment, Explainable AI** - Building interpretable and controllable AI systems




I'm always excited to work on interesting projects and research. Let's connect!
