I'm fascinated by the idea of building something that will be infinitely smarter than us. In the meanwhile, I enjoy exploring how AI can augment research, coding, and learning experiences through novel efficient architectures and self-improving systems.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- **Generative AI** - Pushing boundaries in text, audio, and image synthesis
- **Self-Improving Systems** - Reinforcement learning and autonomous feedback loops
- **AI Safety & Alignment, Explainable AI** - Building interpretable and controllable AI systems
